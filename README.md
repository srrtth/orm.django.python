# Employee Management System (Django ORM-based)

![Employee Management System]

## Introduction

The Employee Management System is a Django Python software that provides a user-friendly interface to manage employee data within an organization. It utilizes Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for seamless interaction with the database, making it a powerful and efficient tool for HR and management personnel.

This system offers four main functions:

1. **Add Employee**: Add new employees to the database with detailed information, including name, contact details, job title, and more.

2. **Delete Employee**: Remove employees from the system, allowing for easy management of employee turnover.

3. **Update Employee**: Modify the information of existing employees, keeping the database up-to-date with any changes.

4. **Print Employee Details**: Display a list of all employees, with the ability to filter and search for specific employees, making it easy to retrieve important information.
